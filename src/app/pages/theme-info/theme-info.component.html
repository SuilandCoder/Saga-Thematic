      <p>SAGA stands for System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses.  SAGA GIS has been developed by a small group of developers primarily based in Germany. Most past and current SAGA developments come from the team around J. Böhner and O. Conrad, both are now working at the Institute of Geography, Section for Physical Geography, Klimacampus and University of Hamburg, Germany.

          The System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses (SAGA) is an open source geographic information
          system (GIS), mainly licensed under the GNU General Public License. Since its first release in
          2004, SAGA has rapidly developed from a specialized tool for digital terrain analysis to a
          comprehensive and globally established GIS platform for scientific analysis and modeling. SAGA
          is coded in C++ in an object oriented design and runs under several operating systems including
          Windows and Linux. Key functional features of the modular software architecture comprise an
          application programming interface for the development and implementation of new geoscientific
          methods, a user friendly graphical user interface with many visualization options, a command
          line interpreter, and interfaces to interpreted languages like R and Python. The current version
          2.1.4 offers more than 600 tools, which are implemented in dynamically loadable libraries or
          shared objects and represent the broad scopes of SAGA in numerous fields of geoscientific
          endeavor and beyond. In this paper, we inform about the system's architecture, functionality,
          and its current state of development and implementation. Furthermore, we highlight the wide
          spectrum of scientific applications of SAGA in a review of published studies, with special
          emphasis on the core application areas digital terrain analysis, geomorphology, soil science,
          climatology and meteorology, as well as remote sensing<sup>[1]</sup>.<br/></p>
